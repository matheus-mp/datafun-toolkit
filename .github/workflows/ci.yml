# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI (Docs Site)

# WHY: Validate docs and repo metadata on PRs and pushes.
# OBS: This workflow validates only; it never deploys.

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
# - CI VALIDATES, never modifies
# - Scope naming (ABCD) reinforces CI/CD patterns
# - Fail fast design - catch issues early

# CI PHASES A-B-C-D:
# - Always: Always do basic checks, and assemble: install dependencies, verify environment setup
# - Baseline: Core validation (types exist, lint passes, tests pass)
# - Coverage: Generate coverage / testing reports
# - Deploy: Build package and docs (sanity checks for release readiness)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch: # WHY: Allow manual triggering from Actions tab.

permissions: # WHY: Use least privileges required.
  contents: read

env:
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1" # WHY: Real-time logging.
  PYTHONIOENCODING: "utf-8" # WHY: Ensure UTF-8 encoding so docs with international characters work.
